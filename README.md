# Morse Code Project

### This project is a two-way translator between Latin letters and Morse code.

##### Colour Palette

The colour palette, as with the remainder of my portfolio, utilises colours from Australian flora. Therefore, I decided to use a wattle colour palette with a lot of bright yellows, pale greys and dark, forest greens. This is based on a combination of colour palettes, including this one: https://icolorpalette.com/download/palette/526587_color_palette.jpg

##### Structure

The structure of the translator is a combination between https://morsedecoder.com/ and https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/morse-code. I decided to have two separate parts of the site for Morse Code to Latin and Latin to Morse Code.

The page is effectively divided in two, with the left hand side being used for Morse Code to Latin translation and the right hand side being used for Latin to Morse Code translation.
