# Morse Code Project

### This project is a two-way translator between Latin letters and Morse code.

##### Colour Palette

The colour palette, as with the remainder of my portfolio, utilises colours from Australian flora. Therefore, I decided to use a wattle colour palette with a lot of bright yellows, pale greys and dark, forest greens. This is based on a combination of colour palettes, including this one: https://icolorpalette.com/download/palette/526587_color_palette.jpg

##### Structure

The structure of the translator is a combination between https://morsedecoder.com/ and https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html.

The page is effectively divided in two, with the left hand side being used for input and the right hand side being used for output.

TO DO:
ensure characters can be written with - OR \_.
ensure spaces can be written with | or /
fix issues with characters and when each function occurs
add some extra characters
search for characters in string and see if any of them have no key value pair assigned.
